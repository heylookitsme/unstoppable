All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c5">For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.&nbsp; In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.&nbsp; The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp; For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply; provide that for dispute of less than $50,000 we may elect and require arbitration by the JAMS streamlined rules of arbitration.&nbsp; The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp; This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.&nbsp; </span><span class="c7">Under no circumstances will class action or representative procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.&nbsp; However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.&nbsp; The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="c7 c16">Class Action Waiver</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both You and We specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c16">Jury Waiver</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, You and We are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.&nbsp; In the absence of this Provision, You and We might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.&nbsp; Other rights that You would have if You went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and&nbsp;certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Severability</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.&nbsp; If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court.</span></p>
